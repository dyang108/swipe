## Some notes regarding this project:
* MongoDB is probably not the best database for this project, since our data is very structured
* I want to be able to expand this to other schools, and some parts of the page are not conducive to scalability, especially the Carm and Dewick things...
* Security is a big issue for a project like this... I want good security people to test it and give me good info...

TODO:
* Create a profile page with the following fields:
    * History feed
    * Facebook information
    * Invite friends
    * Phone number
* Integrate Twilio for notifications
* More satisfying client-side response for quickpost
* User database for profile information
